# MIT-HSSP-Modeling-Mechanics-and-Circuits
Notes and finished code for custom MIT ESP Class: Modeling Circuits and Mechanics via Differential Equations and Javascript.

**About the class:**
The core idea behind this class is that modeling is the process of transcribing the physical world into the realm of math, and there are many decisions we need to make along the way. We turn to math to be able to study a system rigorously, creating a model to not only understand the current state of the system but also to make predictions on future states.

In this class, we will explore some very successful models, including the _lumped element model_ in circuit theory. Additionally, we will explore oscillators, which provide the basis for many approximations made in physics. The mathematical underpinnings of many of these systems are _differential equations_, which are equations relating a function and its derivatives.

**Class Structure:**
Ideally, half of the class will be dedicated to introducing the theory (physics and math) of a system of interest. We will use these to find a 'master' equation that describes the system. In the second half, we will visualize what this master equation is telling us by coding a small simulation in JavaScript.

**About HSSP:**
HSSP is a spring and summer program run by MIT's Educational Studies Program (ESP) where MIT students teach high-schoolers anything they're passionate about!
Instructors have a lot of freedom about what material to present and how to go about doing it, and in this way, this class has been constantly changing, as this is the 3rd time it's been taught.
