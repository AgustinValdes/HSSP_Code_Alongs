About HSSP:

HSSP is a spring and summer program run by MIT's Educational Studies Program (ESP) where MIT students teach high-schoolers anything they're passionate about!
Instructors have a lot of freedom about what material to present and how to go about doing it, and in this way, this class has been constantly changing, as this is the 3rd time it's been taught.
